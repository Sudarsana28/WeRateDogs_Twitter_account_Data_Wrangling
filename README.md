# WeRateDogs_Twitter_account_Data_Wrangling

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about their dog.  It was started in 2015 by college student named Matt Nelson and has received international media coverage both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media. It has acquired more than 7 million followers since it's debut.   

This account also has a unique rating system. The ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. But the numerators are almost always greater than 10 with ratings such as 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." Now, this statement is a sarcastic answer given from the WeRateDogsTwitter account during a celebrated exchange in which the account shut down a person taking issue with their rating system. This exchange (conversation) was also a massive success for the account with the answer gaining popularity as ‘One of the best memes of 2016’ and the account gained 50,000 followers as a result of the exchange.   

I happened to do a Data Analysis project on this account’s data and discovered various interesting insights. I have also included some pictorial representations to make the entire data visualization process both colourful and meaningful.
